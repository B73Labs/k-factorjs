# pressure-advance-js
Script to generate a test g-code for pressure advance calibration in Klipper based on k-factorjs for Marlin LIN_ADVANCE

See https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Pressure_Advance.md for the latest Pressure Advance documentation

This script was created by modifying k-factorjs https://github.com/Sineos/k-factorjs

That script was inspired by https://mattshub.com/2017/10/02/linear-advance/ (look for the script by Sebastianv650)

All credits for the idea go to token47 (https://github.com/token47/k-factor)
